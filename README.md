# Estee-Lauder-Challenge
For this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive website promoting Estee Lauder’s Nutritious Line.
I focused on designing responsive layouts and UI components to enhance user experience and aligning with the brand’s vision.
I also applied web design best practices for performance optimization and cross-device compatibility.
